"""Detect when a transcript came back in the wrong writing system.

Several catalog models decide the language themselves and cannot be pinned
(Dolphin, SenseVoice, Qwen3-ASR). On a short recording — which is most of
dictation — their detection can land on a completely unrelated language:
"ठीक है" comes back from both Dolphin and Qwen3-ASR as Chinese, and "नमस्ते"
from Dolphin as Cyrillic.

That is worse than an error, because it reaches the cursor looking like a real
transcript. Comparing the script of the result against the script the requested
language is written in turns a silent wrong answer into an honest failure.

The check is deliberately lenient, since a false rejection throws away a good
transcript. It never fires on an unknown language, on `auto`, or on text without
letters, and it requires only a minority of letters to be in the expected script
so that code-switching ("मैं report Friday तक send करूंगा") always passes.
